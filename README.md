# Personal information java console 
   that uses heap structure 

This program is a Java console called "Personal information", designed to manage and display information about people, such as their name, age, birthday, and relationship status.
It uses a heap structure,implemented with a PriorityQueue to store and organize data efficiently based on age.

# What it can do:
1. Add Records: Users can add as many persons as    needed, and the heap will automatically sort them by age.
2. Display Sorted Data: The program displays all persons sorted by age, using the heap structure to ensure efficient ordering.
3. User-Friendly Interaction: The application provides a simple menu-based interface for adding data, viewing the sorted list, and exiting.


I made this application because it serves as a learning tool which contributes to personal development 
and to the community also it mimics the real-world scenario like organizing personal data or managing and maintaining sorted records.
how it contributes to me and to the community is it provides experience in creating a friendly console application which it serves as a learnig resource that can be great to students that  are in the community, it illustrates how data structure can be applied in daily life.
